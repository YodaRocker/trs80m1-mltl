Welcome, this is trs80m1-mltl, a machine language "tape linker" for the
TRS-80 Model I personal microcomputer.

This utility takes a raw binary file, and packs it into a format which
Level II machines can load into memory and execute using the command `SYSTEM'.

The output file format is CAS, which can easily be used by most emulators, and
with the use of a conversion utility, can be recorded onto a real tape as well,
for use with real hardware.

The purpose of this tool is to allow the development of TRS-80 Model I tape
software in a modern environment.  In particular, it's been tested using the
ZASM assembler, which you can find here:

You can find example programs in the `examples' directory of the project.
